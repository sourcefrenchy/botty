First steps in Rust to annoy participants enjoying reverse engineering binaries - this is for an upcoming CTF I organize. 

*note*: a stripped binary in rust is awful in Ghidra (takes 40 mins to decompile and trying to go through the functions.. ) freezing my laptop most of the time. Ida seems better but annoying enough versus dynamic analysis.
