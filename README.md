First steps in Rust to annoy participants liking reverse engineering to an upcoming CTF I organize. 

Just trying to generate a windows PE without having to install Windows and being able to run the code on Linux as well. Trying to obfuscate a little bit stuff to force participants to tcpdump while running the binary. 

*note*: a stripped binary in rust is awful in Ghidra (takes 40 mins to decompile and trying to go through the functions.. ) freezing my laptop most of the time. Ida seems better but annoying enough versus dynamic analysis.
